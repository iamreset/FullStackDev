            <li>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Energetic, Motivated and Confused with the idea that if I run around i will ultimately run into what I really enjoy more than other things
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    very well educated, have many degrees including a masters but what i do is what i like not what i have been taught
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    phew! I have tons of experience which makes me over-qualified for pretty much half of the jobs out there. For the remaining half i am under-qualified
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting along with everyone. I can fold my sleeves and work on anything with a team. I am yet to find something where I had missing skills when my team had to deliver something.
